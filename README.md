# JavaScript-30
30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge from [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

## Day 1: Drum Kit
I am creating a drum kit using Javascript and a bunch of audio files

What I learned:
- ```addEventListener``` can listen to a lot of events
- Playing audio files is as simple as running ```.play()```
- ```querySelector``` can be used to select a matched element
- For every key pressed, there’s a lot of information being passed to the function
- ```classList``` returns a list of all classes which can be modified

## Day 2: JS and CSS Clock
I am creating a simlpe Clock just using JS and CSS

What I learnd:
- I can easily set inline styles using ```Element.style```
- Transforming an element is, by default, at the center
- ```Element.style.Property = ''``` resets the styling

## Day 3: Playing with CSS Variables and JS
I had already known CSS variables and ```forEach``` in JS.

So, what I learnd:
- All of the data attributes can be accessed using ```dataset```
- ```QuerySelectorAll``` returns a NodeList, which is kind of like an Array, except that it’s not
- CSS Custom Properties can be changed using the ```setProperty``` method
## Day 4: Array Cardio Day 1
Today we are going to work with Arrays and the different methods that we can use: ```filter()```, ```map()```, ```sort()```, ```reduce()```.

What I learnd:
- ```map()``` and ```sort()``` will always return the same number of items
- An initial value is very important in the ```reduce()``` method
- How 1 and -1 work in the ```sort()``` method
