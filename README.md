# JavaScript-30
30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge from [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

## Day 1: Drum Kit
I am creating a drum kit using Javascript and a bunch of audio files

What I learned:
- ```addEventListener``` can listen to a lot of events
- Playing audio files is as simple as running ```.play()```
- ```querySelector``` can be used to select a matched element
- For every key pressed, thereâ€™s a lot of information being passed to the function
- ```classList``` returns a list of all classes which can be modified

## Day 2: JS and CSS Clock
I am creating a simlpe Clock just using JS and CSS

What I learnd:
- I can easily set inline styles using ```Element.style```
- Transforming an element is, by default, at the center
- ```Element.style.Property = ''``` resets the styling
