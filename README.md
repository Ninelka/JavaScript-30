# JavaScript-30
30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge from [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

## Day 1: [Drum Kit](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/JS%20Drum%20Kit/)
I am creating a drum kit using Javascript and a bunch of audio files

What I learned:
- ```addEventListener``` can listen to a lot of events
- Playing audio files is as simple as running ```.play()```
- ```querySelector``` can be used to select a matched element
- For every key pressed, there’s a lot of information being passed to the function
- ```classList``` returns a list of all classes which can be modified

## Day 2: [JS and CSS Clock](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/CSS+JS%20Clock/)
I am creating a simlpe Clock just using JS and CSS

What I learned:
- I can easily set inline styles using ```Element.style```
- Transforming an element is, by default, at the center
- ```Element.style.Property = ''``` resets the styling

## Day 3: [Playing with CSS Variables and JS](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/Playing%20with%20CSS%20Variables%20and%20JS/)
I had already known CSS variables and ```forEach``` in JS.

So, what I learned:
- All of the data attributes can be accessed using ```dataset```
- ```QuerySelectorAll``` returns a NodeList, which is kind of like an Array, except that it’s not
- CSS Custom Properties can be changed using the ```setProperty``` method

## Day 4: [Array Cardio Day 1](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/Array%20Cardio%20Day%201/)
Today we are going to work with Arrays and the different methods that we can use: ```filter()```, ```map()```, ```sort()```, ```reduce()```.

What I learned:
- ```map()``` and ```sort()``` will always return the same number of items
- An initial value is very important in the ```reduce()``` method
- How 1 and -1 work in the ```sort()``` method

## Day 5: [Flex Panels Image Gallery](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/Flex%20Panels%20Image%20Gallery/)
We made an image gallery with CSS Flexbox.

What I learned today:
- The ```toggle()``` method is a cool way to literally toggle classes
- Using ```includes()``` we can check if something has a certain word or character that we are looking for
- To make image gallery like on many frontpages of a photographers portfolio it really isn’t hard

## Day 6: [Type Ahead](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/Ajax%20Type%20Ahead/)

In the lesson we are using ```fetch()``` and ```filter()``` methods and also takes advantage of regular expressions to build a simple filter for american cities. Did the same with russian cities in parallel branch

## Day 7: [Array Cardio Day 2](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/Array%20Cardio%20Day%202/)
Today We will explore six JavaScript array functions: ```some()```, ```every()```, ```find()```, ```findIndex()```, ```splice()``` and ```slice()```
## Day 8: [Fun with HTML5 Canvas](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/Fun%20with%20HTML5%20Canvas/)
Today we are going to create a drawing game using the HTML5 canvas element.
We will need to:

- Stretch the canvas to fill the window ```height``` and ```width```.
- Set the base settings of the ```strokeStyle```, ```lineJoin``` and ```lineCap```.
- Set default drawing variables (to control so the drawing only happens when the mouse is down - not just when the mouse moves).
- Set default variables to hold the beginning and ending coordinates for drawing lines.
- Create some event listeners and a function to handle drawing.
- Add a rainbow styled stroke (first initialising ```hue``` and then setting the ```strokeStyle``` to an hsl colour)

## Day 9: [14 Must Know Dev Tools Tricks](https://ninelka.github.io/JavaScript-30/14%20Must%20Know%20Dev%20Tools%20Tricks/)
Today we're learning 14 Must know Dev tools tricks:
1. Inspect the element in the dev tools (```Break on... > attribute modifications```)
2. ```console.log()```
3. Interpolate (use ```%s```)
4. Styled Console Logging (add ```%c``` at the beginning of the message)
5. Warnings in the Console (use ```console.warn()```)
6. Errors in the Console (use ```console.error()```)
7. Information in the Console (use ```console.info()```)
8. Using ```console.assert()``` for Testing
9. Clearing the Console (use ```console.clear() ```)
10. View DOM Elements (use ```console.dir()```)
11. Grouping Together (use ```console.group(name)``` and ```console.groupEnd(name)```)
12. Counting Instances (use ```console.count()```)
13. Timing (use ```console.time()``` and ```console.timeEnd()```)
14. Log in a table (use ```console.table()```)
